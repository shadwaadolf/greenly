### Release Integrity

Releases are created automatically and signed using the [Node team's GPG key](https://pgp.mongodb.com/node-driver.asc). This applies to the git tag as well as all release packages provided as part of a GitHub release. To verify the provided packages, download the key and import it using gpg:

```shell
gpg --import node-driver.asc
```

The GitHub release contains a detached signature file for the NPM package (named
`mongodb-X.Y.Z.tgz.sig`).

The following command returns the link npm package.
```shell
npm view mongodb@vX.Y.Z dist.tarball
```

Using the result of the above command, a `curl` command can return the official npm package for the release.

To verify the integrity of the downloaded package, run the following command:
```shell
gpg --verify mongodb-X.Y.Z.tgz.sig mongodb-X.Y.Z.tgz
```

>[!Note]
No verification is done when using npm to install the package. The contents of the Github tarball and npm's tarball are identical.

# Installation

The recommended way to get started using the Node.js 2.0 driver is by using the `NPM` (Node Package Manager) to install the dependency in your project.

## MongoDB Driver

Given that you have created your own project using `npm init` we install the mongodb driver and it's dependencies by executing the following `NPM` command.

```
npm install mongodb --save
=======
### Support / Feedback

For issues with, questions about, or feedback for the Node.js driver, please look into our [support channels](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/support). Please do not email any of the driver developers directly with issues or questions - you're more likely to get an answer on the [MongoDB Community Forums](https://community.mongodb.com/tags/c/drivers-odms-connectors/7/node-js-driver).

### Change Log

Change history can be found in [`HISTORY.md`](https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/blob/HEAD/HISTORY.md).

### Compatibility

The driver currently supports 3.6+ servers.

** 3.6 support is deprecated and support will be removed in a future version **

For exhaustive server and runtime version compatibility matrices, please refer to the following links:

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/node/current/compatibility/#mongodb-compatibility)
- [NodeJS](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/node/current/compatibility/#language-compatibility)

#### Component Support Matrix

The following table describes add-on component version compatibility for the Node.js driver. Only packages with versions in these supported ranges are stable when used in combination.

#### Typescript Version

We recommend using the latest version of typescript, however we currently ensure the driver's public types compile against `typescript@4.4.0`.
This is the lowest typescript version guaranteed to work with our driver: older versions may or may not work - use at your own risk.
Since typescript [does not restrict breaking changes to major versions](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Breaking-Changes), we consider this support best effort.
If you run into any unexpected compiler failures against our supported TypeScript versions, please let us know by filing an issue on our [JIRA](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/NODE).

Additionally, our Typescript types are compatible with the ECMAScript standard for our minimum supported Node version.  Currently, our Typescript targets es2021.

## Installation

The recommended way to get started using the Node.js 5.x driver is by using the `npm` (Node Package Manager) to install the dependency in your project.

After you've created your own project using `npm init`, you can run:

```bash
npm install mongodb
# or ...
yarn add mongodb
>>>>>>> 791278a4638196eebb9ec290a9926db209cd791c
```

This will download the MongoDB driver and add a dependency entry in your `package.json` file.

<<<<<<< HEAD
## Troubleshooting

The MongoDB driver depends on several other packages. These are.

* mongodb-core
* bson
* kerberos
* node-gyp

The `kerberos` package is a C++ extension that requires a build environment to be installed on your system. You must be able to build node.js itself to be able to compile and install the `kerberos` module. Furthermore the `kerberos` module requires the MIT Kerberos package to correctly compile on UNIX operating systems. Consult your UNIX operation system package manager what libraries to install.

{{% note class="important" %}}
Windows already contains the SSPI API used for Kerberos authentication. However you will need to install a full compiler tool chain using visual studio C++ to correctly install the kerberos extension.
{{% /note %}}

### Diagnosing on UNIX

If you don’t have the build essentials it won’t build. In the case of linux you will need gcc and g++, node.js with all the headers and python. The easiest way to figure out what’s missing is by trying to build the kerberos project. You can do this by performing the following steps.

```
git clone https://github.com/christkv/kerberos.git
cd kerberos
npm install
```

If all the steps complete you have the right toolchain installed. If you get node-gyp not found you need to install it globally by doing.

```
npm install -g node-gyp
```

If correctly compiles and runs the tests you are golden. We can now try to install the mongod driver by performing the following command.

```
cd yourproject
npm install mongodb --save
```

If it still fails the next step is to examine the npm log. Rerun the command but in this case in verbose mode.

```
npm --loglevel verbose install mongodb
```

This will print out all the steps npm is performing while trying to install the module.

### Diagnosing on Windows

A known compiler tool chain known to work for compiling `kerberos` on windows is the following.

* Visual Studio c++ 2010 (do not use higher versions)
* Windows 7 64bit SDK
* Python 2.7 or higher

Open visual studio command prompt. Ensure node.exe is in your path and install node-gyp.

```
npm install -g node-gyp
```

Next you will have to build the project manually to test it. Use any tool you use with git and grab the repo.

```
git clone https://github.com/christkv/kerberos.git
cd kerberos
npm install
node-gyp rebuild
```

This should rebuild the driver successfully if you have everything set up correctly.

### Other possible issues

Your python installation might be hosed making gyp break. I always recommend that you test your deployment environment first by trying to build node itself on the server in question as this should unearth any issues with broken packages (and there are a lot of broken packages out there).

Another thing is to ensure your user has write permission to wherever the node modules are being installed.

QuickStart
==========
The quick start guide will show you how to setup a simple application using node.js and MongoDB. Its scope is only how to set up the driver and perform the simple crud operations. For more in depth coverage we encourage reading the tutorials.

Create the package.json file
----------------------------
Let's create a directory where our application will live. In our case we will put this under our projects directory.

```
mkdir myproject
cd myproject
```

Enter the following command and answer the questions to create the initial structure for your new project

```
npm init
```

Next we need to edit the generated package.json file to add the dependency for the MongoDB driver. The package.json file below is just an example and your will look different depending on how you answered the questions after entering `npm init`

```
{
  "name": "myproject",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "My first project",
  "main": "index.js",
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "git://github.com/christkv/myfirstproject.git"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "mongodb": "~2.0"
  },
  "author": "Christian Kvalheim",
  "license": "Apache 2.0",
  "bugs": {
    "url": "https://github.com/christkv/myfirstproject/issues"
  },
  "homepage": "https://github.com/christkv/myfirstproject"
}
```

Save the file and return to the shell or command prompt and use **NPM** to install all the dependencies.

```
npm install
```

You should see **NPM** download a lot of files. Once it's done you'll find all the downloaded packages under the **node_modules** directory.

Booting up a MongoDB Server
---------------------------
Let's boot up a MongoDB server instance. Download the right MongoDB version from [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org), open a new shell or command line and ensure the **mongod** command is in the shell or command line path. Now let's create a database directory (in our case under **/data**).

```
mongod --dbpath=/data --port 27017
=======
If you are a Typescript user, you will need the Node.js type definitions to use the driver's definitions:

```sh
npm install -D @types/node
```

## Driver Extensions

The MongoDB driver can optionally be enhanced by the following feature packages:

Maintained by MongoDB:

- Zstd network compression - [@mongodb-js/zstd](https://github.com/mongodb-js/zstd)
- MongoDB field level and queryable encryption - [mongodb-client-encryption](https://github.com/mongodb/libmongocrypt#readme)
- GSSAPI / SSPI / Kerberos authentication - [kerberos](https://github.com/mongodb-js/kerberos)

Some of these packages include native C++ extensions.
Consult the [trouble shooting guide here](https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/blob/HEAD/etc/notes/native-extensions.md) if you run into compilation issues.

Third party:

- Snappy network compression - [snappy](https://github.com/Brooooooklyn/snappy)
- AWS authentication - [@aws-sdk/credential-providers](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3/tree/main/packages/credential-providers)

## Quick Start

This guide will show you how to set up a simple application using Node.js and MongoDB. Its scope is only how to set up the driver and perform the simple CRUD operations. For more in-depth coverage, see the [official documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/node/).

### Create the `package.json` file

First, create a directory where your application will live.

```bash
mkdir myProject
cd myProject
```

Enter the following command and answer the questions to create the initial structure for your new project:

```bash
npm init -y
```

Next, install the driver as a dependency.

```bash
npm install mongodb
```

### Start a MongoDB Server

For complete MongoDB installation instructions, see [the manual](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/).

1. Download the right MongoDB version from [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/downloads)
2. Create a database directory (in this case under **/data**).
3. Install and start a `mongod` process.

```bash
mongod --dbpath=/data
>>>>>>> 791278a4638196eebb9ec290a9926db209cd791c
```

You should see the **mongod** process start up and print some status information.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Connecting to MongoDB
---------------------
Let's create a new **app.js** file that we will use to show the basic CRUD operations using the MongoDB driver.

First let's add code to connect to the server and the database **myproject**.

```js
var MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient
  , assert = require('assert');

// Connection URL
var url = 'mongodb://localhost:27017/myproject';
// Use connect method to connect to the Server
MongoClient.connect(url, function(err, db) {
  assert.equal(null, err);
  console.log("Connected correctly to server");

  db.close();
});
```

Given that you booted up the **mongod** process earlier the application should connect successfully and print **Connected correctly to server** to the console.

Let's Add some code to show the different CRUD operations available.

Inserting a Document
--------------------
Let's create a function that will insert some documents for us.

```js
var insertDocuments = function(db, callback) {
  // Get the documents collection
  var collection = db.collection('documents');
  // Insert some documents
  collection.insertMany([
    {a : 1}, {a : 2}, {a : 3}
  ], function(err, result) {
    assert.equal(err, null);
    assert.equal(3, result.result.n);
    assert.equal(3, result.ops.length);
    console.log("Inserted 3 documents into the document collection");
    callback(result);
  });
}
```

The insert command will return a results object that contains several fields that might be useful.

* **result** Contains the result document from MongoDB
* **ops** Contains the documents inserted with added **_id** fields
* **connection** Contains the connection used to perform the insert

Let's add call the **insertDocuments** command to the **MongoClient.connect** method callback.

```js
var MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient
  , assert = require('assert');

// Connection URL
var url = 'mongodb://localhost:27017/myproject';
// Use connect method to connect to the Server
MongoClient.connect(url, function(err, db) {
  assert.equal(null, err);
  console.log("Connected correctly to server");

  insertDocuments(db, function() {
    db.close();
  });
});
```

We can now run the update **app.js** file.

```
node app.js
```

You should see the following output after running the **app.js** file.

```
Connected correctly to server
Inserted 3 documents into the document collection
```

Updating a document
-------------------
Let's look at how to do a simple document update by adding a new field **b** to the document that has the field **a** set to **2**.

```js
var updateDocument = function(db, callback) {
  // Get the documents collection
  var collection = db.collection('documents');
  // Update document where a is 2, set b equal to 1
  collection.updateOne({ a : 2 }
    , { $set: { b : 1 } }, function(err, result) {
    assert.equal(err, null);
    assert.equal(1, result.result.n);
    console.log("Updated the document with the field a equal to 2");
    callback(result);
  });  
}
```

The method will update the first document where the field **a** is equal to **2** by adding a new field **b** to the document set to **1**. Let's update the callback function from **MongoClient.connect** to include the update method.

```js
var MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient
  , assert = require('assert');

// Connection URL
var url = 'mongodb://localhost:27017/myproject';
// Use connect method to connect to the Server
MongoClient.connect(url, function(err, db) {
  assert.equal(null, err);
  console.log("Connected correctly to server");

  insertDocuments(db, function() {
    updateDocument(db, function() {
      db.close();
    });
  });
});
```

Delete a document
-----------------
Next lets delete the document where the field **a** equals to **3**.

```js
var deleteDocument = function(db, callback) {
  // Get the documents collection
  var collection = db.collection('documents');
  // Delete document where a is 3
  collection.deleteOne({ a : 3 }, function(err, result) {
    assert.equal(err, null);
    assert.equal(1, result.result.n);
    console.log("Removed the document with the field a equal to 3");
    callback(result);
  });
}
```

This will delete the first document where the field **a** equals to **3**. Let's add the method to the **MongoClient
.connect** callback function.

```js
var MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient
  , assert = require('assert');

// Connection URL
var url = 'mongodb://localhost:27017/myproject';
// Use connect method to connect to the Server
MongoClient.connect(url, function(err, db) {
  assert.equal(null, err);
  console.log("Connected correctly to server");

  insertDocuments(db, function() {
    updateDocument(db, function() {
      deleteDocument(db, function() {
        db.close();
      });
    });
  });
});
```

Finally let's retrieve all the documents using a simple find.

Find All Documents
------------------
We will finish up the Quickstart CRUD methods by performing a simple query that returns all the documents matching the query.

```js
var findDocuments = function(db, callback) {
  // Get the documents collection
  var collection = db.collection('documents');
  // Find some documents
  collection.find({}).toArray(function(err, docs) {
    assert.equal(err, null);
    assert.equal(2, docs.length);
    console.log("Found the following records");
    console.dir(docs);
    callback(docs);
  });
}
```

This query will return all the documents in the **documents** collection. Since we deleted a document the total
documents returned is **2**. Finally let's add the findDocument method to the **MongoClient.connect** callback.

```js
var MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient
  , assert = require('assert');

// Connection URL
var url = 'mongodb://localhost:27017/myproject';
// Use connect method to connect to the Server
MongoClient.connect(url, function(err, db) {
  assert.equal(null, err);
  console.log("Connected correctly to server");

  insertDocuments(db, function() {
    updateDocument(db, function() {
      deleteDocument(db, function() {
        findDocuments(db, function() {
          db.close();
        });
      });
    });
  });
});
```

This concludes the QuickStart of connecting and performing some Basic operations using the MongoDB Node.js driver. For more detailed information you can look at the tutorials covering more specific topics of interest.

> **NOTE:** Resolving DNS Connection issues
>
> Node.js 18 changed the default DNS resolution ordering from always prioritizing IPv4 to the ordering
> returned by the DNS provider. In some environments, this can result in `localhost` resolving to
> an IPv6 address instead of IPv4 and a consequent failure to connect to the server.
>
> This can be resolved by:
>
> - specifying the IP address family using the MongoClient `family` option (`MongoClient(<uri>, { family: 4 } )`)
> - launching mongod or mongos with the ipv6 flag enabled ([--ipv6 mongod option documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/program/mongod/#std-option-mongod.--ipv6))
> - using a host of `127.0.0.1` in place of localhost
> - specifying the DNS resolution ordering with the `--dns-resolution-order` Node.js command line argument (e.g. `node --dns-resolution-order=ipv4first`)

```js
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');
// or as an es module:
// import { MongoClient } from 'mongodb'

// Connection URL
const url = 'mongodb://localhost:27017';
const client = new MongoClient(url);

// Database Name
const dbName = 'myProject';

async function main() {
  // Use connect method to connect to the server
  await client.connect();
  console.log('Connected successfully to server');
  const db = client.db(dbName);
  const collection = db.collection('documents');

  // the following code examples can be pasted here...

  return 'done.';
}

main()
  .then(console.log)
  .catch(console.error)
  .finally(() => client.close());
```

Run your app from the command line with:

```bash
node app.js
```

The application should print **Connected successfully to server** to the console.

### Insert a Document

Add to **app.js** the following function which uses the **insertMany**
method to add three documents to the **documents** collection.

```js
const insertResult = await collection.insertMany([{ a: 1 }, { a: 2 }, { a: 3 }]);
console.log('Inserted documents =>', insertResult);
```

The **insertMany** command returns an object with information about the insert operations.

### Find All Documents

Add a query that returns all the documents.

```js
const findResult = await collection.find({}).toArray();
console.log('Found documents =>', findResult);
```

This query returns all the documents in the **documents** collection.
If you add this below the insertMany example, you'll see the documents you've inserted.

### Find Documents with a Query Filter

Add a query filter to find only documents which meet the query criteria.

```js
const filteredDocs = await collection.find({ a: 3 }).toArray();
console.log('Found documents filtered by { a: 3 } =>', filteredDocs);
```

Only the documents which match `'a' : 3` should be returned.

### Update a document

The following operation updates a document in the **documents** collection.

```js
const updateResult = await collection.updateOne({ a: 3 }, { $set: { b: 1 } });
console.log('Updated documents =>', updateResult);
```

The method updates the first document where the field **a** is equal to **3** by adding a new field **b** to the document set to **1**. `updateResult` contains information about whether there was a matching document to update or not.

### Remove a document

Remove the document where the field **a** is equal to **3**.

```js
const deleteResult = await collection.deleteMany({ a: 3 });
console.log('Deleted documents =>', deleteResult);
```

### Index a Collection

[Indexes](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/indexes/) can improve your application's
performance. The following function creates an index on the **a** field in the
**documents** collection.

```js
const indexName = await collection.createIndex({ a: 1 });
console.log('index name =', indexName);
```

For more detailed information, see the [indexing strategies page](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/applications/indexes/).

## Error Handling

If you need to filter certain errors from our driver, we have a helpful tree of errors described in [etc/notes/errors.md](https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/blob/HEAD/etc/notes/errors.md).

It is our recommendation to use `instanceof` checks on errors and to avoid relying on parsing `error.message` and `error.name` strings in your code.
We guarantee `instanceof` checks will pass according to semver guidelines, but errors may be sub-classed or their messages may change at any time, even patch releases, as we see fit to increase the helpfulness of the errors.

Any new errors we add to the driver will directly extend an existing error class and no existing error will be moved to a different parent class outside of a major release.
This means `instanceof` will always be able to accurately capture the errors that our driver throws.

```typescript
const client = new MongoClient(url);
await client.connect();
const collection = client.db().collection('collection');

try {
  await collection.insertOne({ _id: 1 });
  await collection.insertOne({ _id: 1 }); // duplicate key error
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof MongoServerError) {
    console.log(`Error worth logging: ${error}`); // special case for some reason
  }
  throw error; // still want to crash
}
```

## Nightly releases

If you need to test with a change from the latest `main` branch, our `mongodb` npm package has nightly versions released under the `nightly` tag.

```sh
npm install mongodb@nightly
```

Nightly versions are published regardless of testing outcome.
This means there could be semantic breakages or partially implemented features.
The nightly build is not suitable for production use.
